##Standard Deviation

-Standard Deviation (SD) is the measure of spread of the numbers in a set of data from its mean value.

standard deviation is the square root of variance

-Variance is defined and calculated as the average squared deviation from the mean.

-For a finite set of numbers, the standard deviation is found by taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations of the values from their average value. For example, the marks of a class of eight students (that is, a population) are the following eight values:
2,\  4,\  4,\  4,\  5,\  5,\  7,\  9.
These eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:
    \frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5.  
First, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and square the result of each:

    \begin{array}{lll}
    (2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\
    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\
    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (7-5)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\
    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (9-5)^2 = 4^2 = 16. \\
    \end{array}
  
The variance is the mean of these values:
\frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = 4.
and the **population** standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:
\sqrt{ 4 } = 2.

-Sample variance where it is (n-1) The purpose of this little difference it to get a better and unbiased estimate of the population‘s variance

-The standard deviation is important because, regardless of the mean, it makes a great deal of difference whether the distribution is spread out over a broad range or bunched up closely around the mean

##Web Analytics

-Web analytics is a generic term meaning the study of the impact of a website on its users.

-Knowing what Standard Deviation is and how it’s used in Web Analytics will help you get an idea of just how important events that happen on your website could be
